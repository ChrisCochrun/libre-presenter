** TODO bug in changing slides with the arrows
[[file:~/dev/church-presenter/src/qml/presenter/Presentation.qml::function changeSlide() {]]

** TODO Check for edge cases in inputing wrong vorder and lyrics
[[file:~/dev/church-presenter/TODO.org::*Fix broken append when importing River song][Fix broken append when importing River song]]

** TODO Images stored in sql need to have aspect saved and applied dynamically here
[[file:~/dev/church-presenter/src/qml/presenter/Slide.qml::fillMode: Image.PreserveAspectCrop]]

** TODO Build out a slide preview system so we can see each slide in the song or image slideshow
[[file:~/dev/church-presenter/src/qml/presenter/SongEditor.qml::Presenter.SlideEditor {]]

** TODO Fix possible bug in arrangingItems in draghandler [1/3] [33%]
[[file:~/dev/church-presenter/src/qml/presenter/DragHandle.qml::function arrangeItem() {]]

- [X] Basic fixed drag n drop
- [ ] Allow for a less buggy interaction
- [ ] Need to check for edge cases

** TODO [#A] Make Presentation Window follow the presenter component
[[file:~/dev/church-presenter/src/qml/presenter/MainWindow.qml::Presenter.Slide {]]

** TODO Make toolbar functional for songeditor
[[file:~/dev/church-presenter/src/qml/presenter/SongEditor.qml::Controls.ToolBar {]]

- [ ] Will likely need to modify the model to persist the effects stored to the songs. Alignment is done, need vertical alignment, font, and effects

** TODO Finish toolbar in presentation display
[[file:~/dev/church-presenter/src/qml/presenter/Presentation.qml::Controls.ToolBar {]]

** TODO Find a way to maths the textsize
[[file:~/dev/church-presenter/src/qml/presenter/Slide.qml::property real textSize: 50]]

** TODO Create a nextslide function to be used after the end of the list of slides
[[file:~/dev/church-presenter/src/qml/presenter/Presentation.qml::function nextSlide() {]]

- [ ] Check to make sure this works in all conditions but I believe it works ok.

** TODO Make sure the video gets changed in a proper manner to not have left over video showing from previous items
[[file:~/dev/church-presenter/src/qml/presenter/Presentation.qml::currentServiceItem++;]]

- [X] Build a basic system that changes to black first and then switches to the video
- [ ] Build out a loading system that will load the next video if it needs to and then the switch can be instant.

  The second option is the best, but requires a lot more work. I have the first already working so I'll come back to this once I have more of an idea of how to do it.

** DONE images and videos need a better get system
[[file:~/dev/church-presenter/src/videosqlmodel.cpp::QVariantList VideoSqlModel::getVideo(const int &row) {]]

** DONE Fix broken append when importing River song
[[file:~/dev/church-presenter/src/qml/presenter/LeftDock.qml::function appendItem(name, type, background, backgroundType, text, itemID) {]]

This was due to the song not having a vorder. Need to protect from edge cases of the user inputing the formatted text that doesn't fit what's expected in code.

** DONE implement previousSlide and previousAction
[[file:~/dev/church-presenter/src/qml/presenter/Presentation.qml::function nextSlide() {]]

** DONE Need to make ListModel capable of bringing in a string list [2/2] [100%]
- [X] Create a Model
- [X] Create a class that we'll make a list of in the model

** DONE Make an image sql model
[[file:~/dev/church-presenter/src/videosqlmodel.h::ifndef VIDEOSQLMODEL_H]]

** DONE Parse Lyrics to create a list of strings for slides
SCHEDULED: <2022-03-23 Wed 10:00>

** DONE BUG in dropping and then selecting song will duplicate entries :dev:
SCHEDULED: <2022-04-05 Tue>
[[file:~/dev/church-presenter/src/qml/presenter/LeftDock.qml::Layout.fillHeight: true]]

or at least turns the entry above it into the same as itself while retaining it's title?

** DONE Make nextSlideText a nextAction function to incorporate other types of items
[[file:~/dev/church-presenter/src/qml/presenter/Presentation.qml::function nextSlideText() {]]

** DONE Fix file dialog using basic QT theme
[[file:~/dev/church-presenter/src/qml/presenter/SongEditor.qml::FileDialog {]]
